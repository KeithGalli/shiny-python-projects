## Sales Dashboard Project

[Sales Dashboard Project](./sales)

Given 12 months of (mock) sales data from an electronics store, what type of Shiny application can we build?

This project walks through the basics of Shiny, how reactivity works, how to customize your application layout, and more. This is a great place to start if you are new to Shiny.
